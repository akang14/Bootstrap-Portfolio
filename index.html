                            Hello world! My name is Austin Kang and I am a 22 year old student currently enrolled at
                            UCI's
                            Coding Bootcamp.
                            For the past few years I have been searching for a career path that fits my best interests
                            and
                            recently a friend of mine introduced me to coding.
                            It really caught my attention so I started going online and tried to learn it myself, but
                            was only
                            able to get so far. That's when I found out about
                            the coding bootcamp and decided I wanted to enroll immediately. I'm hoping that after this 6
                            month
                            intensive my skills in coding have improved tremendously.
                            My goal is to land a job at a company as a web-developer. I'm super excited to be here and
                            motivated
                            to learn!
